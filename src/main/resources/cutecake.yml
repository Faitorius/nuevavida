    intro: >
      It's the late afternoon, and you're out in town on your daily business, walking along feeling stressed out as
      usual. Even though you aren't really in a rush, your general feelings of frustration make you hurry home, and so
      you take a shortcut down a small side-street. You're not really paying attention as you walk along, and so you're
      taken by surprise about halfway down the alley when a figure reaches out from a doorway to lay a hand lightly on
      your arm.

          Yikes! This is a startling thing to happen! Still, maybe it's perfectly innocent. Take a step away to get
          a bit of distance between you and ask this stranger what they want.

          You move to step away from the figure, but they say something that you don't quite catch in your rising
          panic, and jab their hand towards you. You do a double take, and realise that they're holding a cake.
        next:
        - Cake?

          'Oh no! Maybe you should run for help before you get stab... wait, a cake? That\'s not dangerous at all!'

          You take a proper look at the strange and alarming figure, and realise that it's a slightly-built
          middle-aged woman. She's giving you a friendly smile, and holding out what looks to be a freshly made cupcake.


          Feeling a little shaken, almost as if you expected something horrid to happen, you ask her if you can help.

          "Oh my, I didn't scare you did I?" She says, "I just thought you looked so awfully down in the dumps, and
          perhaps one of our cupcakes might cheer you up."
        next:
        - Eat the cake
        - No thanks

      Eat the cake:
        desc: Free cake? That's your favourite kind!

      No thanks:
        desc: Offering you free cake? No thank you!

          "You rudely snap at the baker and tell her to leave you alone. Then you turn away and stomp back home.

          For some reason, being rude to her makes you feel a little relaxed. It's almost as if you're a horrible
          person, but no, she surely must have had it coming.")

          : "You politely decline the baker's offer, and get back on your way home."

      Throw it in her face:
        desc: Offering you free cake? How dare she! Throw it right in her cake-making face. That'll teach her.

      Say goodbye:
        desc: Say goodbye and be on your way back home.

      Offer to model:
        desc: They just need a better model for their poster... you could do it!

      Model for the bakery:
        desc: Isn't it every girl's dream to model with a cupcake? Go for it!

      No thanks!:
        desc: Having your face up in a bakery for everyone to look at? No thank you!

      Buy a cake:
        desc: Buy one of their delicious cupcakes.

        desc: Continue on your way home.
