    desc: It's the late afternoon, and you're out in town on your daily business, walking along feeling stressed out as
      usual. Even though you aren't really in a rush, your general feelings of frustration make you hurry home, and so
      you take a shortcut down a small side-street. You're not really paying attention as you walk along, and so you're
      taken by surprise about halfway down the alley when a figure reaches out from a doorway to lay a hand lightly on
      your arm.

      - name: Move away
        desc: Yikes! This is a startling thing to happen! Still, maybe it's perfectly innocent. Take a step away to get
              a bit of distance between you and ask this stranger what they want.
        text: You move to step away from the figure, but they say something that you don't quite catch in your rising
              panic, and jab their hand towards you. You do a double take, and realise that they're holding a cake.
        next:
        - '''Cake?'''

          'Oh no! Maybe you should run for help before you get stab... wait, a cake? That\'s not dangerous at all!'

          'You take a proper look at the strange and alarming figure, and realise that it\'s a slightly-built
          middle-aged woman. She\'s giving you a friendly smile, and holding out what looks to be a freshly made cupcake.


          Feeling a little shaken, almost as if you expected something horrid to happen, you ask her if you can help.

          "Oh my, I didn\'t scare you did I?" She says, "I just thought you looked so awfully down in the dumps, and
          perhaps one of our cupcakes might cheer you up."'

      - name: Offer to model
        desc: They just need a better model for their poster... you could do it!

      - name: Model for the bakery
        desc: Isn't it every girl's dream to model with a cupcake? Go for it!

      - name: No thanks!

      - name: Buy a cake
        desc: Buy one of their delicious cupcakes.
