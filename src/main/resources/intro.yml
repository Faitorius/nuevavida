      "A few years from now:


      The last few years have not been the best for you. You're single, you've mostly lost contact with your friends
      and family, and you don't even have much of a job to speak of.

      Worse, as your finances took a dive you were forced to apply for a housemate, and unfortunately you found one.
      He's a tall, thin and ragged young man who eschews his given name for the moniker \"Skeeve\".


      For now though, you're alone at home. It's the evening, and you're mindlessly clicking away on the internet."

          actual message. An actual message from someone you know!

          The sender seems to be Ivy, a young woman you met on a web forum and sometimes exchange email with. She's some
          kind of scientist from an unexceptional city somewhere in the UK.

          Answering it, you find yourself confronted by two large men. \"Where's Skeeve?\" one of them grunts in a voice

          You tell the thugs that you've no idea where your housemate has gone. They shove you out of the way and barge
          inside, ready to ransack his room. When they slam the door open though, you see that it's completely empty. Not
          only is Skeeve not there, but all his things are gone too. There's just a scrap of paper lying on the bed.

          The slightly more tattooed thug snatches it up, reads it, and then hands it to you. "Sorry dudes", it starts
          "I've skipped town, so you can kiss your money goodbye, unless you can persuade my loser housemate to cough up."

          You look up to see the hoods' cold vicious eyes staring down at you. "Two hundred thousand" one says. "Pay up

          The two morons turn to look, and quick as a flash you pop open a window and nimbly make your way out of it.


          Half an hour later you stop to catch your breath. You\'ve lost the hoods, but whichever criminal organisation
          they represent, they\'ll surely be on your tail. You need to get out of this town.'

      Go to Ivy:
        desc: Take Ivy up on her offer and travel to her city.
        text: You find a payphone and sort out your travel arrangements. The next day, after a fearful night in a hotel,
          you're on your way.

          A few legs of the journey later, evening finds you on a train pulling into the station in Ivy's town. You queue
          up at a taxi rank. It's drizzling, the sky is a leaden grey, and you can't help but feel that this is a grim
          and dreary place to live.
        next:
        - Take a taxi

      Take a taxi:
        desc: Take a taxi to Ivy's home.
        text: The taxi lets you off outside Ivy's home and drives off.

          Ivy's neighbourhood isn't what you were expecting. She lives well outside the town centre in a street of
          run-down houses. You see several that are definitely abandoned, and  most of them are badly neglected. You know
          that Ivy works as a research scientist, so you would have thought that she could afford to live in a nicer area.

          Ivy's home stands out like a sore thumb in this grimy area. The street light next to you is broken, but even
          in growing darkness you can see that it's clean and well maintained, with the front door painted a cheerful green.

          You walk up to it and use the weighty metal knocker.
        next:
        - Wait for Ivy

      Wait for Ivy:
        desc: Wait for Ivy to answer the door.
        text: >

          greetings and she invites you inside."
        next:
        - Explain your problems

      Explain your problems:
        desc: Tell Ivy all about your debt/murder troubles.
        text: You sit down at the kitchen table and Ivy makes tea as you explain your problem to her. She taps away at a
          shiny laptop as you speak, and soon finds details on this "Murderin' Mervin".

          The information is not comforting. It seems he's part of the Railroad Gang, a criminal organisation with
          international reach. He's been arrested several times for murder, assault and extortion but never convicted.
          Not because he was innocent, but because judges have been bribed and juries intimidated.

          Ivy shakes her head sadly. "I have a few connections, but no-one who can face down someone like this. Your best
          bet is to go into hiding.

          I know some backdoors to the ID databases and between that and a forger who owes me some favours, I could sort
          you out with a new identity."
        next:
        - Get a new identity
        - Find Skeeve

      Find Skeeve:
        desc: Start a new life? Here in Ivy's city? No way! You'll track down Skeeve instead!
        text: You tell Ivy that you'd much rather track down this "Skeeve" fellow and make him pay, rather than going
          into hiding. She manages to find some clues to where he might be on the computer, but warns you that this will
          be a dangerous choice, and that you'd be better off making a new life here.
        next:
        - Get a new identity
        - "Find Skeeve "

      "Find Skeeve ":
        desc: "Yes, you're sure. Forget starting a new life, hunting down your hapless former housemate is the thing to do.

          WARNING: THIS CHOICE WILL END THE GAME."
        text: >
          scene.flags.remove('WITH_IVY');
          "You tell Ivy you're sure, take the information about Skeeve, and leave.


          A week later, you track him down, and show up unannounced at his front door. He looks at you with shock and
          terror, too pathetic to even speak."
        next:
        - Take pity on him
        - Make him pay
        - Give him a thrashing

      Take pity on him:
        desc: Take pity on Skeeve and go on the run together.
        text: >
          Looking at him, you realise you don't have the heart to make this loser pay up. If Ivy found him, so can
          Mervin, so you grab his arm and haul him out of his crappy hiding hole and onto the run with you.

          Fleeing from murderous criminals, the two of you have many adventures, grow as people, learn new skills and
          eventually form a special bond together. In time, your talents honed to a razor-edge from training in a lost
          mountaintop ninja monastery, you confront Murderin\' Mervin and his boss in an epic confrontation.

          But that is another story.


          THE END

      Give him a thrashing:
        desc: Grab whatever implement is nearest to hand and use it to deliver a sound thrashing.
        text: >
          You muscle Skeeve into his hallway and grab the nearest implement, which turns out to be a broom. Using this
          stout length of wood you hand out a painful beating.

          Unfortunately, your victim's wails come to the attention of a passing police officer and you're arrested.

          The judge sentences you to a secure women's prison. Soon you're locked away within its grim grey walls,
          nothing to do except have pillow fights with your fellow inmates and soap up each others' breasts in the
          showers. Truly, this is a hell on earth.


          THE END

      Make him pay:
        desc: His debt, his payment. Force him to pay up, no matter what he has to do to get the money.
        text: >
          You demand that Skeeve pay his debt to the criminals. It turns out he can't afford it, so you force him into
          sex work to raise the money. Before long you've become a successful pimp, with a large entourage of sexy
          man-whores. Skeeve is your best and most popular rent boy, and comes to love the prostitute lifestyle.

          Even when the debt is paid off, Skeeve keeps on working as a streetwalker. You find yourself feeling
          increasingly strange about it though, and eventually you realise that all the time you were pimping him out you
          were also falling in love with him.

          Luckily you can take the pimping solution of claiming him as your personal sex toy, something Skeeve has no
          problem with whatsoever.

          You're very happy with your new life, and don't even mind when your friend Ivy browbeats Skeeve into helping
          with one of her inventions and he ends up pregnant. Still, you do sometimes wonder how things would have turned
          out if you'd gone into hiding in Ivy's city instead.


          THE END

      Get a new identity:
        desc: Get a new identity", "Yes! This is the perfect solution
        text: >
          Ivy types away at her computer for a bit, and sends some messages to a forger she has some sort of connection with.

          Eventually she looks up from the screen and eyes you speculatively. "Well, I can get you a new identity, but
          there are a few things that we can't really hack in the system. This ID I have is for someone in their early
          twenties. Can you pull that off?"

        desc: Sure. This is a situation that absolutely justifies letting your friend experiment on you with an alarmingly large machine.
        text: >
          Ivy leads you down into the basement, where bright white lights illuminate an odd contraption about the size of
          a wardrobe. She pours the rare powdered MacGuffinite into an intake funnel, and then opens up the door.

          At her bidding you change into a fragile patient's gown that appears to be made out of paper. Once you've
          changed, she delightedly straps you into the interior of the device. The padded insides of the machine are
          surprisingly comfortable, and if Ivy's taken care with something as unimportant as comfort, then surely it must
          be fine when it comes to big issues like safety... right?

          She gives you a reassuring smile, then shuts the door with a clang.

          You find yourself in a metal box, with loops of wire protruding from the walls and ceiling, the space
          illuminated by blinking green lights.


          You think you hear Ivy say something, but the sound is muffled by the machine and you can't make out what she's
          saying. Then, the whole device begins to hum. Softly at first, then louder, then it begins to shake, rattling
          your teeth. You can feel a buildup of charge in the air around you.

          The humming stops for a moment, and you think the experiment's finished, but then a massive arc of some sort of
          energy discharge blasts from top to bottom of the machine, rushing through you, apparently without causing any
          damage. Lights flash in front of your eyes, and you feel an odd buzzing sensation throughout your body. Looking
          down as far as the straps allow, you realise that the energy seems to have burnt your paper gown clean off your
          body, transforming it into a few fragments of papery ash.


          Before you have time to scream or thrash around, the energy flow slows and then stops. Ivy lets you out of the
          machine and leads you to a full length mirror.

          Standing naked in front of it, you look at your body. The body of a fit and healthy woman in her early twenties.


          Ivy claps you on the back. "Complete success! Now, I'll just fill in the rest of your details for the ID. Could
          you describe yourself in as much detail as possible?"
