    A few years from now:


    The last few years have not been the best for you. You're single, you've mostly lost contact with your friends
    and family, and you don't even have much of a job to speak of.

    Worse, as your finances took a dive you were forced to apply for a housemate, and unfortunately you found one.
    He's a tall, thin and ragged young man who eschews his given name for the moniker "Skeeve".


    For now though, you're alone at home. It's the evening, and you're mindlessly clicking away on the internet.

    There\'s also a pair of criminal-looking thugs here, but let\'s not lower ourselves to detailed descriptions

  actions:
    Check your email:
      desc: Maybe you have some new email. That would be more interesting than the site you're currently browsing. What
        kind of idiot thinks pink and white is a good colour scheme for a blog?
      text: You open up your email, hoping to at least have some vaguely interesting spam. To your surprise, you have an
        actual message. An actual message from someone you know!

        The sender seems to be Ivy, a young woman you met on a web forum and sometimes exchange email with. She's some
        kind of scientist from an unexceptional city somewhere in the UK.
      next:
      - Read the email

    Read the email:
      desc: Well, you could just sit here staring at the subject line, or you could actually click on the bloody thing.
      text: You open up the message and see that it's an invitation from Ivy to come visit her. It seems that she's been
        having a tough time lately after a mishap with some baldness cure she developed, and she could use some company.
      next:
      - Consider her offer

    Consider her offer:
      desc: Think about it. After all, you have plenty of time to consider her offer. It's not like something contrived
        and dramatic is going to force you over there.
      text: >
        scene.flags.add('THUGS_ARRIVED');
        'You pause to consider her offer, but you\'re distracted by the doorbell.

        Answering it, you find yourself confronted by two large men. "Where\'s Skeeve?" one of them grunts in a voice
        that clearly isn\'t used to words of more than half a syllable.'
      next:
      - You don't know

    You don't know:
      desc: You've no idea where he is right now.
      text: >
        You tell the thugs that you've no idea where your housemate has gone. They shove you out of the way and barge
        inside, ready to ransack his room. When they slam the door open though, you see that it's completely empty. Not
        only is Skeeve not there, but all his things are gone too. There's just a scrap of paper lying on the bed.

        The slightly more tattooed thug snatches it up, reads it, and then hands it to you. "Sorry dudes", it starts
        "I've skipped town, so you can kiss your money goodbye, unless you can persuade my loser housemate to cough up."

        You look up to see the hoods' cold vicious eyes staring down at you. "Two hundred thousand" one says. "Pay up
        bitch" says the other.
      next:
      - Explain yourself

    Explain yourself:
      desc: You have nothing to do with this! Surely they'll understand that.
      text: You try to explain how this is none of your business, but the cruellest of the thugs cuts you short with a
        threatening gesture. "No excuses bitch. You'd better pay, or you'll find out why they call me 'Murderin Mervin'."
      next:
      - Escape!
      - "scene.flags.contains('OFFERED_SEXUAL_FAVOURS') ? '' : 'Offer sexual favours'"
      - "scene.flags.contains('BEGGED') ? '' : 'Beg'"
      - "scene.flags.contains('BE_MURDERED') ? '' : 'Be murdered'"

    Escape!:
      desc: Distract the thugs and make your escape!
      text: >
        scene.flags.remove('THUGS_ARRIVED');
        '"Look!" You shout, pointing behind the thugs, "It\'s Skeeve, and he has a gun!"

        The two morons turn to look, and quick as a flash you pop open a window and nimbly make your way out of it.


        Half an hour later you stop to catch your breath. You\'ve lost the hoods, but whichever criminal organisation
        they represent, they\'ll surely be on your tail. You need to get out of this town.'
      next:
      - Go to Ivy

    Offer sexual favours:
      desc: Offer to sleep with the thugs in exchange for forgetting about the money.
      text: >
        scene.flags.add('OFFERED_SEXUAL_FAVOURS');
        'You bat your eyelashes at Murderin\' Mervin and offer to give him a good time if he\'ll let you off the hook.

        "Shut up bitch", he replies curtly. "I\'d have taken that offer from Skeeve, but not from the likes of you."'
      next:
      - Escape!
      - "scene.flags.contains('BEGGED') ? '' : 'Beg'"
      - "scene.flags.contains('BE_MURDERED') ? '' : 'Be murdered'"

    Beg:
      desc: Beg for mercy. Murderin' Mervin sounds like a merciful guy, right?
      text: >
        scene.flags.add('BEGGED');
        'You appeal to Murderin\' Mervin\'s better nature. Unsurprisingly, this has no effect whatsoever.'
      next:
      - Escape!
      - "scene.flags.contains('OFFERED_SEXUAL_FAVOURS') ? '' : 'Offer sexual favours'"
      - "scene.flags.contains('BE_MURDERED') ? '' : 'Be murdered'"

    Be murdered:
      desc: Be murdered. This is usually considered a bad life choice.
      text: >
        scene.flags.add('BE_MURDERED');
        'You apparently decide to just be murdered. Are you sure?'
      next:
      - Actually, no
      - Kill me already!

    Actually, no:
      desc: Change your mind and don't be murdered. This has the advantage of you not being the victim of a murder.
      text: >
        In a moment of sanity, you decide that being murdered might not be a good idea after all.
      next:
      - Escape!
      - "scene.flags.contains('OFFERED_SEXUAL_FAVOURS') ? '' : 'Offer sexual favours'"
      - "scene.flags.contains('BEGGED') ? '' : 'Beg'"

    Go to Ivy:
      desc: Take Ivy up on her offer and travel to her city.
      text: You find a payphone and sort out your travel arrangements. The next day, after a fearful night in a hotel,
        you're on your way.

        A few legs of the journey later, evening finds you on a train pulling into the station in Ivy's town. You queue
        up at a taxi rank. It's drizzling, the sky is a leaden grey, and you can't help but feel that this is a grim
        and dreary place to live.
      next:
      - Take a taxi
